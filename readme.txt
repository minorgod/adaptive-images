Adaptive images plugin transparently resizes your images, per device screen size, in order to reduce download times in 
mobile environments. 



== Description ==

= Adaptive Images Solution =

Resizes and optimizes images delivered to mobile devices, in a transparent and unobtrusive way, so that the total 
download time is dramatically reduced. It works as a filter between the device and your WordPress website. It actually 
works for all types of deveice screen sizes, although it is targeted mostly at mobile environments. 

= Fundamental goals = 

 1. Reduce the total download time in mobile devices dramatically.
 2. Work unobtrusively. Enable it and it works. Disable it vanishes.
 3. Provide a totally transparent solution, independant of your code.
 4. Be agnostic of the yet-not-finalized `picture` element or `srcset` attribute.

= Supported formats =

 - JPEG (adjustable quality)
 - PNG (is transformed to PNG8)
 - GIF (not animated)
 - HiDPI (high device pixel ratio screens).

= Default breakpoints =

 - 1024px wide screens
 - 640px wide screens
 - 480px wide screens

Since version 0.5.0 and upwards it is configurable whether the plugin should take into account the landscape or the 
portrait orientation of each device.

= How to test = 

 1. Test with Chrome Canary&apos;s device emulation mode in Developer Tools. Firefox&apos;s Responsive Design Mode does 
    not emulate a mobile screen size!
 2. Test with a tool like Webpagetest http://www.webpagetest.org/. Make sure you set the "Emulate Mobile Browser" 
    setting in the "Advanced Settings" > "Chrome" tab. 
 3. Test with a tool like GTmetrix http://gtmetrix.com/. Make sure you enable mobile device testing. The plugin will 
    have no effect on desktop sized devices.
 4. Test with an actual mobile device, a smartphone or tablet. Watch your website load in a snap.
 5. Check in the `/wp-contents/cache` directory to see the `/adaptive-images` directory and its contents. This is where 
    the resized images are kept and cached by default.

Do not test with a normal desktop browser! A usual browser will simply be served the original images without them 
being resized at all. This is the whole idea: serving each device the image sizes which are appropriate for it.

 = Stuff to keep in mind = 

 - The plugin needs to add a little bit of code to your `.htaccess` file in order to function properly. It removes 
   this code  once disabled. If you are not cool with that, then&hellip; tough luck! 
 - It cannot work out of the box with a CDN (or Varnish server, for that matter), because the CDN or Varnish server 
   are unaware of the device size cookie and they cannot know in a definitive way which image they should serve or 
   cache for each device.
 - It does not care whether the device is actually mobile or not. It checks the device screen resolution. If you have 
   set your breakpoints big enough then it should work just as good for desktop devices as well. However it targets 
   mostly the mobile ones.
 - The resized versions of the pictures are kept in a special directory in the `/wp-content/cache` directory. 

Thank you for using the plugin and, please, do let us know how it works (or doesn't work) for you. We love comments 
and creative feedback!

= Credits = 

 - It was originally based on the WP-Resolutions plugin https://github.com/JorgenHookham/WP-Resolutions/ but right, now 
   it is a complete rewrite!
 - Both plugins, WP-Resolutions and this one, take ideas from the Adaptive Images http://adaptive-images.com/ adapted 
   specifically for WordPress. 



== Installation ==

= No surprises here =

 1. Install the plugin via "Plugins > Add New".
 2. Activate the plugin.
 3. It should simply work!
 4. De-activate the plugin to disable it.
 4. Activate the plugin to enable it.

= Debugging =

 1. See the &quot;How to test&quot; paragraph in the &quot;Description&quot; tab.
 2. Hit the &quot;Print debug info&quot; button in the plugin settings page and check the output.
 3. Hit the &quot;Print diagnostics&quot; button in the plugin settings page and check the output.
 4. View an image straight from a browser and add a &quot;?debug=true&quot; at the end of the url like this 
    &quot;http://www.website.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?debug=true&quot;. This should print useful debug
    information about the plugin functions in your installation. If you keep seeing your image then the plugin is not
    working and the cause is probably the failure to update the .htaccess file properly.

= Incompatibilities =

 1. Does not support WordPress Multisite (^Î¼ or MU) yet.
 2. Supports Nginx but it must be manually configured.
 3. Cannot work with installations where the /wp-content directory is not in its default position, which is inside the 
    root directory of the WordPress installation.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the story? =

First came the Adaptive images solution http://adaptive-images.com/ which is still there and works on its own. Then 
came the WP-Resolutions plugin https://github.com/JorgenHookham/WP-Resolutions. But it is not in the WordPress plugin
repository anymore and the Github version is not compatible with the latest WordPress versions. So we are updating and
maintaining it. Many under the hood changes have taken place, but the overall functionality is the same.

= Is this plugin heavy? =

Well, not much really. The image resizing process is not computationally negligible, but the images are only resized 
when they are first requested and then they are cached. However, it must be noted that the images in the watched 
directories, the ones the plugin is responsible for resizing and delivering, are ultimately delivered by a PHP script 
and not a generic server process! 

= Can it work with a CDN/Varnish? =

Not out of the box! The reason is that the service responsible for delivering the images (in this case the CDN or Varnish) must be aware of the resizing process and the client cookie it is based on. If one has access to their CDN or
Varnish configuration, then they could probably extend it to take that cookie into account and act accordingly.

= Does the plugin help with art direction? =

No! Simple as that. Art direction in responsive images is an entirely different, yet important, problem. This plugin 
does not tackle with it. But it works in a supplementary way. This means that you can combine it with any art 
direction solution. This plugin will continue to work and serve resized versions of your responsive images even after 
you have done art direction on them.



== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin settings page in the admin area.
2. Resized versions of your images are cached by default in `/wp-content/cache/adaptive-images`.
3. Total web page load time is reduced dramatically on a mobile device (tested in http://webpagetest.org/).
4. Each device is served an image resized its real dimensions, therefore a lot smaller in total size.



== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.5.0 =

It is recommended, but not absolutely necessary, to save ones settings anew, due to the big change in the image 
resizing script, which was completely re-written, renamed and relocated inside the plugin&apos;s directories since this 
version. 

= 0.3.0 =

Upgrading to version 0.3.0 you may need to:

 - Save settings anew. If you do not then the plugin will operate with its current default settings without problems as 
   it is expected.
 - Manually delete the old image cache directory `/wp-content/cache-ai`. The new default image cache directory is
   `/wp-content/cache/adaptive-images`.

Apologies for the inconvenience! We are still in early versions. What is important is that the plugin actually works 
as intended. We try to minimize the hassle between these versions. This is not expected to happen pretty often.



== Changelog ==

= 0.5.0 =

 - New option in settings to define whether the plugin should use the bigger dimension of a device as its with or take 
   into account the current orientation. Up to now the plugin used the width of the landscape orientation, which is the 
   biggest of each device&apos;s dimensions.
 - New option in settings to define whether the plugin should use take special care for HiDPI (retina, high pixel 
   density screens and serve these devices better quality images according to their pixel density.
 - Better PNG compression via PNG8. This converts true color PNG images to palette image, which reduces colours and the 
   alpha channel Kudos http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5752514/how-to-convert-png-to-8-bit-png-using-php-gd-library/.
 - Fixed some edge cases of not being able to serve a resized image by reverting to original image. 
 - More analytical settings page debugging and diagnostics.
 - Added debugging methods in the image cache generation script.
 - Some ocumentation stuff (as always).
 - Completely rewritten the script that generates and caches the resized versions of images in order to avoid the GPL 
   vs CC-BY-3.0 licensing incompatibility of the original Adaptive Images script (http://adaptive-images.com/). Plugin 
   is now totally independant and free of any licensing issues.
 - Due to the above, the image resizing script is no longer the same, it has been transformed to a new script, named 
   `adaptive-images-script.php` which is in the root folder of the plugin. However the old script is still left inside 
   the plugin folders for compatibility purposes (old versions and users not having saved their settings anew).

= 0.3.52 =

 - Documentation stuff.

= 0.3.51 =

 - Minor bug in settings page url parameters.
 - Documentation stuff.

= 0.3.5 =

 - Allow for default browser cache settings.
 - More thorough debugging information.
 - Added diagnostics debugging in the settings page.
 - Nicer admin area user messages with icons.
 - Minor fixes here (and there).
 - Documentation enhancements.

= 0.3.04 =

 - Documentation enhancements (yeah).
 - Added &quot;noptimize&quot; tag in HEAD Javascript to exclude it from optimizers.

= 0.3.03 =

 - Added Last-modified HTTP header for resized images, as the best practices do suggest.

= 0.3.02 =

 - When no device size/resolution is detected then show the original image. Helps avoid misunderstandings and sends 
   search engines the actual images instead of the resized ones.

= 0.3.01 =

 - Documentation enhancements.

= 0.3.0 =

 - Almost a complete rewrite of the code.

 - Added action in the settings page for cache size calculation.
 - Added watched directories field in the settings page anew.
 - Divided the plugin files into logical parts.
 - Default resolutions changed to 1024, 640 and 480 because the cookie is set based on the max value between screen 
   width and height and most screens have a height between 480 and 640px. Tablets are between 640 and 1024px wide/tall.
   The iPad is 1024px tall. A screen with a width higher than 1024px is probably not a mobile screen.

= 0.2.05 =

 - If the original requested image width and the device screen size are bigger than maximum available breakpoint, then 
   serve the the original image. 

= 0.2.04 =

 - Refactoring code.

= 0.2.03 =

 - Set the default screen size breakpoints to 1024, 600, 320.

= 0.2.02 =

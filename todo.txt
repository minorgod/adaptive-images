  An off-hand todo list: 
  ======================

   - Some pngs actually become bigger after being resized!
   - Some way to test the resized images (perhaps a fake cookie or param).
   - Ask users to rate plugin after x-images have been cached. 

   - WP Multisite
   - W3 Total Cache
   - Hyper Cache
   - WP Super Cache
   - Autoptimize

   - Add screenshot from GTmetrix.
   - Cleanup Webpagetest screenshot from WURFL.

   - Ajax calculate image cache size.
   - Ajax cleanup image cache size.

   - Put the stylings in separate CSS files.



  Future ideas:
  =============

   - Admin setting for portrait/landscape width.
   - Cleanup cache afer some time, to invalidate it.
   - Cleanup cache if it gets bigger than a given size.
   - When an image is deleted in the media gallery then its resized versions should be deleted, too.
   - What if a user actually wants to see the full version of an image, even in a mobile network? 
   - When breakpoints are changed delete the cache directories of the unused breakpoints.
   - Redirect directly from htaccess to correct image size when the cookie is already available without PHP.
   - Define error handler inside ai-main.php http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php.
   - Send better error images when adaptive images resize does not work. 



  Plugin needs 3 settings in order to function properly:
  ======================================================

   1. database options
   2. htacess file bit
   3. user settings php



  Tests cases to check with each version:
  =======================================

   - Clean install
   - Deactivate then activate plugin
   - Older version upgrade
   - Is GD PHP library available
   - Is .htaccess available/writeable
   - Is user settings file available/writeable
   - Images correctly sent for each breakpoint
   - Uninstall cleanup

  An off-hand todo list
  =====================

  http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/25/efficient-image-resizing-with-imagemagick/

  I found that slightly different -unsharp settings work better 
  (
    -unsharp 0.25x0.08+8.3+0.045 versus 
    -unsharp 0.25x0.25+8+0.065 without optimization
  )
  and that thereâ€™s no need to use -strip.

    Benchmarks
    ==========

      - Image generation
      - Cache calculation
      - Cache purge



    Compatibility
    =============

      - W3 Total Cache
      - WP Super Cache
      - NginX

          location assets {
          }
            
          location ai-cache { ==> *** THE CACHE DIR ***
          }
            
          location / {
            rewrite \.(?:jpe?g|gif|png)$ /adaptive-images.php; ==> *** THE PHP SCRIPT ***
          }

      - Varnish
        Pressidium for configuration
      - SSL (Jonas Tietgen)
        The problem seemed to be wrong settings for my SSL certificate. I installed the plugin WordPress HTTPS and now 
        everything works fine. I guess the problem was that the file was loaded via http instead of https...



    Unit tests for image generation
    ===============================

      - PNG
      - PNG8
      - PNG256
      - PNG with alpha
      - PNG with trasparency
      - GIF
      - GIF with trasparency
      - JPEG

      (Compare with services like TinyPNG, etc.)



    Documentation

      - What-could-go-wrong section for usual problems users have.
      - A website!

  Future ideas
  ============

   - Put the stylings in separate CSS files.
   - Ask users to rate plugin after x-images have been cached. 
   - Ajax calculate image cache size.
   - Ajax cleanup image cache size.
   - Report all folders and files in cache.
   - Per image cache purge.
   - Purge image cache beyond a size.
   - Per breakpoint cache purge.
   - Notify about cache size in WP cron, in WP admin, perhaps an email to the admin.
   - What if a user actually wants to see the full version of an image, even in a mobile network? 
   - When an image is deleted in the media gallery then its resized versions should be deleted, too.
   - When breakpoints are changed delete the cache directories of the unused breakpoints to clean up.
   - Original adaptive images PHP script error log is output inside the plugin files.



  Plugin needs 3 settings in order to function properly
  =====================================================

   1. database options set
   2. htacess file bit inserted
   3. user settings php file created



  Test cases to check with each version
  =====================================

   - Clean install
   - Deactivate then activate
   - Version 0.2.08 upgrade
   - Older version upgrade
   - Print debug info 
   - Images correctly sent for each breakpoint
   - Uninstall cleanup

   - Images

     - JPG
     - GIF
     - GIF with transparency
     - PNG

  An off-hand todo list: 
  ======================

   - PNGs

      - Remove alpha
      - Transform to JPEG
      - Add these as settings?

   - Debuging

      - Debug info
      - Diagnostics info
      - Image header bit
      - Url parameter to image

   - WP Multisite

   - Compatibility

      - W3 Total Cache
      - Hyper Cache
      - WP Super Cache
      - Autoptimize
      - NginX?

   - Add screenshot from GTmetrix.
   - Cleanup Webpagetest screenshot from WURFL.

   - Ask users to rate plugin after x-images have been cached. 
   - Ajax calculate image cache size.
   - Ajax cleanup image cache size.
   - Put the stylings in separate CSS files.



  Future ideas:
  =============

   - Admin setting for portrait/landscape width.
   - Some way to test the resized images (perhaps a fake cookie or param).
   - Cleanup cache afer some time, to invalidate it.
   - Cleanup cache if it gets bigger than a given size.
   - Notify about cache size in WP cron, in WP admin, perhaps an email to the admin.
   - When an image is deleted in the media gallery then its resized versions should be deleted, too.
   - What if a user actually wants to see the full version of an image, even in a mobile network? 
   - When breakpoints are changed delete the cache directories of the unused breakpoints to clean up.
   - Define error handler inside ai-main.php http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php.
   - Send better error images when adaptive images resize does not work. 
   - Original adaptive images PHP script error log is output inside the plugin files.



  Plugin needs 3 settings in order to function properly:
  ======================================================

   1. database options set
   2. htacess file bit inserted
   3. user settings php file created



  Tests cases to check with each version:
  =======================================

   - Clean install
   - Deactivate then activate
   - Version 0.2.08 upgrade
   - Older version upgrade
   - Print debug info 
   - Images correctly sent for each breakpoint
   - Uninstall cleanup

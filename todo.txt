    Benchmarks
    ==========

    - Image generation
    - Cache calculation
    - Cache purge



    Compatibility
    =============

    - W3 Total Cache
    - WP Super Cache
    - NginX

        location assets {
        }
          
        location ai-cache { ==> *** THE CACHE DIR ***
        }
          
        location / {
          rewrite \.(?:jpe?g|gif|png)$ /adaptive-images.php; ==> *** THE PHP SCRIPT ***
        }

    - Varnish
      Pressidium for configuration
    - SSL (Jonas Tietgen)
      The problem seemed to be wrong settings for my SSL certificate. I installed the plugin WordPress HTTPS and now 
      everything works fine. I guess the problem was that the file was loaded via http instead of https...



    Unit tests for image generation
    ===============================

    - PNG
    - PNG8
    - PNG256
    - PNG with alpha
    - PNG with trasparency
    - GIF
    - GIF with trasparency
    - JPEG

    (Compare with services like TinyPNG, etc.)

  Future ideas
  ============

  - Put the stylings in separate CSS files.
  - Ask users to rate plugin after x-images have been cached. 
  - Ajax calculate image cache size.
  - Ajax cleanup image cache size.
  - Report all folders and files in cache.
  - Per image cache purge.
  - Purge image cache beyond a size.
  - Per breakpoint cache purge.
  - Notify about cache size in WP cron, in WP admin, perhaps an email to the admin.
  - What if a user actually wants to see the full version of an image, even in a mobile network? 
  - When an image is deleted in the media gallery then its resized versions should be deleted, too.
  - When breakpoints are changed delete the cache directories of the unused breakpoints to clean up.
  - Original adaptive images PHP script error log is output inside the plugin files.
  - Send original images to search engine bots to preserve their metadata.



  Plugin needs 3 settings in order to function properly
  =====================================================

  1. database options set
  2. htacess file bit inserted
  3. user settings php file created



  Test cases to check with each version
  =====================================

  - Clean install
  - Deactivate then activate
  - Version 0.2.08 upgrade
  - Older version upgrade
  - Print debug info 
  - Images correctly sent for each breakpoint
  - Uninstall cleanup

  - Images

    - JPG
    - GIF
    - GIF with transparency
    - PNG
    - PNG with transparency

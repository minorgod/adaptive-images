
This is an off-hand todo list: 

 - Check that requested files are strictly images
 - Check that requested files are strictly inside the watched directories.
 - Put configuration in a separate file, which will be included.
 - Configuration should not be hardcoded but it should also not require WordPress to load and it should not be 
   overriden in each plugin update.
 - Clean image cache methods.
 - Clean image cache on demand.
 - What about if a user actually wants (!) to see the full versions of images even when in a mobile network?
 - Present htaccess settings more beautifully.

  An off-hand todo list: 
  ======================

   - Allow default expires headers for cached images.
   - More user friendly messages with icons and stuff.
   - Some pngs actually become bigger after being resized!
   - Inform if plugin is activated but settings not yet set.
   - Thank the users for using the plugin and ask them to rate it. 



  Future ideas:
  =============

   - Cleanup cache afer some time, to invalidate it.
   - Cleanup cache if it gets bigger than a given size.
   - When an image is deleted in the media gallery then its resized versions should be deleted, too.
   - What about if a user actually wants to see the full versions of images, even when in a mobile network? 
   - Enable and disable on demand with an admin button that updates the htaccess file.
   - When breakpoints change delete the cache directories of the unused breakpoints.
   - Redirect directly from htaccess to correct image size when the cookie is already available without PHP.
   - Send better error images when adaptive images resize does not work. 



  COULD AN IMAGE OUTSIDE OF THE WATCHED DIRECTORIES BE REQUESTED FROM OUR SCRIPT? SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE!

  WHAT HAPPENS TO IMAGES WITH WIDTH THAT IS BETWEEN TWO BREAKPOINTS? 

  SHOW UPGRADE MESSAGES IN ALL ADMIN PAGES, NOT ONLY IN SETTINGS!

  IF AN IMPORTANT CHECK FAILED THEN PERHAPS THE PLUGIN SHOULD ROLL BACK ITS CHANGES.



  Plugin needs 3 settings in order to function properly:
  ======================================================

   1. database options
   2. htacess file bit
   3. user settings php

   Check for all the above and inform the user accordingly



  Tests to check with each version:
  ==================================

   - Clean install
   - Deactivate then activate plugin
   - Older version upgrade
   - Is GD PHP library available
   - Is .htaccess available
   - Is user settings file available
   - Images are actually sent correctly for each breakpoint
   - Uninstall cleanup

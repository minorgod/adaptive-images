  An off-hand todo list: 
  ======================

   - Allow default expires headers for cached images.
   - More user friendly messages with icons and stuff.
   - Some pngs actually become bigger after being resized!
   - Inform if plugin is activated but settings not yet set.
   - Thank the users for using the plugin and ask them to rate it. 
   - Some way to test the resized images (perhaps fake cookie).
   - Admin setting for portrait/landscape width.



  Future ideas:
  =============

   - Cleanup cache afer some time, to invalidate it.
   - Cleanup cache if it gets bigger than a given size.
   - When an image is deleted in the media gallery then its resized versions should be deleted, too.
   - What about if a user actually wants to see the full versions of images, even when in a mobile network? 
   - Enable and disable on demand with an admin button that updates the htaccess file.
   - When breakpoints change delete the cache directories of the unused breakpoints.
   - Redirect directly from htaccess to correct image size when the cookie is already available without PHP.
   - Send better error images when adaptive images resize does not work. 



  Plugin needs 3 settings in order to function properly:
  ======================================================

   1. database options
   2. htacess file bit
   3. user settings php



  Tests cases to check with each version:
  =======================================

   - Clean install
   - Deactivate then activate plugin
   - Older version upgrade
   - Is GD PHP library available
   - Is .htaccess available/writeable
   - Is user settings file available/writeable
   - Images correctly sent for each breakpoint
   - Uninstall cleanup
